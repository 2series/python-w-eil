# Web server

how web servers work, focusing on the HTTP protocol. Here's a simplified version:

Web servers use the HTTP protocol to communicate with web browsers (clients). Clients send requests for web pages or data, and servers respond with the requested information

Key Concepts:
* HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol): A simple text-based protocol for communication between web browsers and servers.
* Requests: Clients send requests to servers, specifying what they want (e.g., a web page). Requests include a method (like GET or POST), a URL, headers, and sometimes a body.
* Responses: Servers send responses to clients. Responses include a status code (e.g., 200 for success, 404 for not found), headers, and the requested data.

* URLs: URLs specify the location of resources on the web. They can include parameters to provide additional information.

* Cookies: Small pieces of data stored by the browser to maintain state between requests.

In essence, a client asks for something using HTTP, and the server responds with it (or an error message if it can't find it)
