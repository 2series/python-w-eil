The *sequence* following "text, then tokenization, then vector DB" typically involves **embedding and then similarity search**.  

Let's break down why:

**Understanding the Flow**

1. **Text:** You start with raw text data, such as sentences, paragraphs, or entire documents.

2. **Tokenization:** This is the process of breaking down the text into smaller units, called tokens, as we discussed previously. This prepares the text for numerical representation.

3. **Vector DB (Vector Database):** A vector database is designed to store and efficiently search through vectors.  But how do we get vectors from text?

4. **Embedding:** This is the crucial missing step.  Embeddings are numerical representations of the text tokens that capture their semantic meaning.  Think of it as converting words or phrases into a format where similar concepts are closer together in a multi-dimensional space.  Popular embedding models include Word2Vec, GloVe, and more recently, transformer-based models like BERT and Sentence-BERT.

5. **Similarity Search:** Once the text is embedded into vectors, they are stored in the vector DB.  Now you can perform similarity searches.  You provide a query (also converted into a vector embedding) and the vector DB efficiently finds the vectors (and therefore the original text) that are most semantically similar to your query.

**Why This Sequence Matters**

This *sequence* allows you to:

* **Represent Text Meaningfully:** Embeddings capture the semantic essence of text, enabling you to compare and find relationships between different pieces of text based on meaning, not just keywords.
* **Efficient Search:** Vector databases are optimized for searching through high-dimensional vector spaces, making the retrieval of similar text much faster than traditional text-based search methods.

**Example Scenario:**

Imagine you have a large collection of documents and you want to find documents related to "artificial intelligence."

1. You have your **text** documents.
2. You **tokenize** the text in each document.
3. You use an embedding model to create **embeddings** for the tokens.
4. You store these embeddings in a **vector DB**.
5. You create an embedding for the query "artificial intelligence."
6. You use the vector DB to perform a **similarity search** and find the documents with embeddings closest to your query's embedding.

**In conclusion, the complete *sequence* is: Text -> Tokenization -> Embedding -> Vector DB -> Similarity Search.** This pipeline is fundamental for many NLP applications, including semantic search, question answering, and recommendation systems.
