A robots.txt file is a text file that website owners create to communicate with web crawlers (like search engines) and other web robots. It's a way to specify which parts of the website should be crawled or indexed, and which parts should be ignored.

The file is typically placed in the root directory of the website (e.g., `(link unavailable)) and contains instructions in a specific format. Here's an example:


User-agent: *
Disallow: /private-page
Allow: /public-page


In this example:

- User-agent: * specifies that the instructions apply to all web crawlers.
- Disallow: /private-page tells crawlers not to access the /private-page URL.
- Allow: /public-page explicitly allows crawlers to access the /public-page URL.

Common directives in robots.txt files include:

- User-agent: specifies the crawler(s) to which the instructions apply.
- Disallow: specifies URLs or directories that should not be crawled.
- Allow: specifies URLs or directories that can be crawled, overriding any previous Disallow directives.
- Crawl-delay: specifies the minimum time between crawls (to prevent overwhelming the server).

By using robots.txt, website owners can:

- Prevent sensitive or private content from being indexed.
- Reduce server load by limiting crawling frequency.
- Help search engines focus on relevant content.

Keep in mind that robots.txt is not a security measure, and malicious crawlers may ignore its instructions. It's primarily used to guide well-behaved crawlers like search engines.
